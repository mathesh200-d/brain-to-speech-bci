# EEG-Based Brain-to-Speech Communication System

This project uses EEG signal data and LSTM neural networks to classify imagined speech (Yes/No) and convert predictions into voice output.

## Features
- EEG signal preprocessing
- LSTM-based classification
- Real-time prediction
- Text-to-speech output

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- LSTM Neural Networks
- NumPy, Pandas
- pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python brain_to_speech_lstm.py
